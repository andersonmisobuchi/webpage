I obtained my PhD in Physics in the [Weinberg Theory Group](https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/research.html) at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of [Elena Caceres](https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/~elenac/). My research focused on the relationship between quantum information and quantum gravity via the holographic duality. Currently, I'm working as a Scientific Software Developer at OpenEye, Cadence Molecular Sciences.
