I'm a Physics PhD graduate researcher working in the [Weinberg Theory Group](https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/research.html)  at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of [Elena Caceres](https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/~elenac/). My research focuses on the relationship between quantum information and quantum gravity via the holographic duality.
