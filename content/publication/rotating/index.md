abstract: In this work we explore the effect of rotation in the size of a traversable wormhole obtained via a double trace boundary deformation. We find that at fixed temperature the size of the wormhole increases with the angular momentum $J/M \ell$. The amount of information that can be sent through the wormhole increases as well. However, for the type of interaction considered, the wormhole closes as the temperature approaches the extremal limit. We also briefly consider the scenario where the boundary coupling is not spatially homogeneous and show how this is reflected in the wormhole opening.
